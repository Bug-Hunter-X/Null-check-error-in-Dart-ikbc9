This repository demonstrates a common null check error in Dart.  The `bug.dart` file shows the problematic code. The null-aware operator (`??`) is used to handle potential null values, but the assignment of `null` to `_myVariable` illustrates an edge case where unexpected behavior might occur. The solution, `bugSolution.dart`, provides an improved approach using a more robust null handling technique. This example highlights the importance of careful null safety practices in Dart.
